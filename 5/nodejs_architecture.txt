Node.js  architecture consists of several components that work together to handle incoming client requests and process responses. These components are: Requests, Nodejs Server, Event Queue, Event Loop, Thread Pool, External Resources.  Some Advantages: Its asynchronous model and non blocking I/O operation improve the scalability and performance of web applications built on other frameworks. Node js can easily handle multiple client requests without requiring multiple threads consuming less memory and resources. Additionally it is highly scalable and provides high performance.  Node js is also flexible with multiple frameworks and makes the development process easier.
